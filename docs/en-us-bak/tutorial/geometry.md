# Geometry

Geometries are what we call points, lines, and surfaces. There is no concept of a specific chart type, such as histogram, scatter chart, line chart, in F2, but users are able to draw a chart of a specific type, such as pie chart, using graphical syntax. Also, users can draw a mixed combination of charts, combination of line chart and histogram for example, using the same syntax.

The type of chart generated by F2 is determined by geometry. Following figure can help you understand what a geometry is:

## How to declare a geometry

After creating a chart object, you can define the type of geometry as follows:

```js
const geom = chart.point(); // here, the type of geometry is defined as point, this method returns a gemo object 
```

## Type of gemotry

F2 currently supports following types of geometries:

| Type     | Description                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| point    | Used to draw points, bubbles                                 |
| path     | A line formed by connecting unordered points. It is often used to draw path diagrams. |
| area     | An area is formed between the line chart and coordinate system, and the upper and lower ranges can also be specified |
| interval | Interval uses size of area to represent proportion, and is usually in shape of rectangle or arc. It generally constitues a bar chart, pie chart, etc. |
| polygon  | Used to build maps, color maps, etc.                         |
| schema   | Used to build box plot, stock charts, etc.                   |

## Geom Object Methods

A geometry object geom has 2 main methods:

- [attribute](./attribute.html) method: mappings from data to visual channel, set by users.
  + position
  + color
  + size
  + shape
- methods beyond above:
  - style: config drawing property
  - adjust: config data adjustment
  - animate: config animation

## Geometry and Type of Chart

Although F2 doesn't hava a specific concept of chart types, **it still supports all traditional chart types**.

The following table shows the mappings between geometry types and traditional charts in F2. For more detail, see [demos](../demo/index.html)

| geom type |                          chart type                          |                           comments                           |
| :-------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|   point   |                          line chart                          | there are many point types, and points can also be displayed in different coordinate systems, therefore you can also build lots of chart types using points |
|   path    |                          path chart                          |              path chart is unordered line graph              |
|   line    |                   line chart, curve graph                    |     can be converted to radar graph in polar coordinates     |
| interval  | histograms, grouped histograms, waterfall charts, stacked histograms, percentage stacked histograms, nightingale rose charts, pie charts, bar charts, funnel charts, etc. | Through the transformation of the coordinate system, various common types of charts can be generated; all charts can be stacked and  grouped. |
|  polygon  |                       color maps, maps                       |            multiple points can make up a polygon             |
|  schema   |                    k line chart, box plot                    |                      custom chart type                       |

## Geometry and Shape

For each type of geometry, different shapes can be made when using geometries to implement various chart types.Different mappings from visual channels to graphic attributes will also produce different charts:

* Point. Points can be represented by dots, triangles, squares, crosses, or even pictures
* Line. There are fold lines, curves, dotted lines, etc.
* Polygon. It can be a solid polygon, or it can be a hollow, border-only polygon.

The Following provides the different geoms' built-in shape types supported by F2. In subsequent sections, we will discuss the details of shapes.

| geom type | shape                            | comments                                 |
| --------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| point     | 'circle', 'hollowCircle', 'rect' | defaults to 'circle'                     |
| line      | 'line', 'smooth', 'dash'         | 'dash': dash line, 'smooth': smooth line |
| area      | 'area', 'smooth'                 | filled area                              |
| interval  | 'rect'                           |                                          |
| polygon   | 'polygon'                        |                                          |
| schema    | 'candle'                         | k line chart only for now                |

If the shapes of geometries above aren't able to meet your needs, you are free to customize shapes on your own.
